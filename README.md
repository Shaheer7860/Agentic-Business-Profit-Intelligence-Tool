# Agentic Business Profit Intelligence Tool
 This project, Agentic Business Profit Intelligence, is an automated AI analytics tool designed to bridge the gap between raw business data and actionable strategy.  It provides a simple web dashboard where a user can upload a CSV file. An AI-powered pipeline then automatically runs a full analysis, which includes:  Building a predictive model to find the key factors driving profit or sales.  Generating visualizations to illustrate trends.  Creating a narrative summary in plain English that explains what the findings mean for the business.  The final output is a clean dashboard with all the results and a one-click, downloadable PDF report, making data-driven insights accessible to non-technical users.
